Project Allocation and Nomination System
========================================
Put students into groups based on their preferences.  Project Allocation and
Nomination System (PANS) runs on a MySQL database, and stores user accounts and
passwords (SHA1 hashed), preferences, and project information.  It has a web
frontend for students to view projects and fill in preferences.  It also
provides a backend for administrators of the system to manage accounts and
perform/edit group allocation.
